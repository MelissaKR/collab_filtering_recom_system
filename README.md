# Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System with Matrix Factorization in TensorFlow
In this project, a collaborative filtering model with Weighted Alternating Least Squares (WALS) algorithm for Matrix Factorization for recommending products from a specific manufacturer to a store is structured using Tensorflow, and submitted to Google AI Platform.

The data pre-processing and model scripts explained in detail can be found in `
CF_Recommendation_System.ipynb` notebook.
